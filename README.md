### Requirements: software

1. Requirements for `Caffe` and `pycaffe` (see: [Caffe installation instructions](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html))

  **Note:** Caffe *must* be built with support for Python layers!

  ```make
  # In your Makefile.config, make sure to have this line uncommented
  WITH_PYTHON_LAYER := 1
  ```

  You can download my [Makefile.config](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/fast-rcnn-data/Makefile.config) for reference.
2. Python packages you might not have: `cython`, `python-opencv`, `easydict`
3. [optional] MATLAB (required for PASCAL VOC evaluation only)

### Requirements: hardware

1. For training...

### Installation (sufficient for the demo)

1.
